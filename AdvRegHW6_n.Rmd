##Chapter 7, exercise 1 (a)
```{r}
library("arm")

a <- 5
b <- 7
sigma <- 3
x <- runif(100, 0, 50)
n <- length(x)

y <- a + b*x + rnorm(n, 0, sigma)
fake <- data.frame(x,y)

head(fake)
```
```{r}
fit <- lm(y ~ x, data=fake)
display(fit)
```

##Chapter 7, exercise 1 (b & c)
```{r}

plot(x, y, xlab = "x", ylab = "y",  main = "Fake Data and Fitted Regression Line")
a_hat <- coef(fit)[1]

  paste("y =", round(a_hat, 2), "+", round(b_hat, 2), "* x"), adj=0)

Shadow project: This exercise was useful in that it helps one think about visualizations and classic ways to experiment with data.
